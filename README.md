# Pathology Image Analysis For Lung Cancer Prediction Using IBM Watson

 
The main objective of this project is to detect whether the tumor present in a patientâ€™s lung is malignant or benign using Convolution Neural Network (CNN)

In a study published in Nature Medicine, researchers said that lung cancer caused an estimated 160,000 deaths in 2018, making it the most common cause of cancer death in the US. Lung cancer screenings that use low-dose tomography have been shown to reduce mortality by 20-43 percent, but there are still challenges that result in unclear diagnoses, subsequent unnecessary procedures, and high costs. Radiologists also usually have to look through dozens of 2D images within a single CT scan, and cancer can be hard to spot. Deep learning can offer a viable solution to these problems.
